# Vortex Collection Tools

A local toolkit for managing Vortex-installed Skyrim SE collections, with a shared web UI
(`node web/server.js`, binds `127.0.0.1` only) covering two related but distinct jobs:

- **Rebuild Collection** — reinstalls/repairs an already-installed collection's staging folder by
  extracting mod archives directly and replaying the FOMOD installer choices recorded in
  `collection.json`, bypassing Vortex's own slow archive-extraction pipeline. Use this when a
  staging folder has drifted, been corrupted, or you just want a much faster full reinstall than
  Vortex's own "Resume" step.
- **Update Collection** — preserves which mods you've marked Ignored/Disabled across a Vortex-driven
  collection *update* (Vortex otherwise forgets these on every update). This tool never extracts
  archives itself — it only manipulates Vortex's own state database (`state.v2`) before and after
  you click Update/Resume in Vortex's own UI, so Vortex's installer skips the mods it should.

This project is the merger of two previously-separate tools (`Collection-Extractor` and
`vortex-collection-sync`, both under `F:\Claude Projects\Vortex\`) into one shared codebase and web
UI, kept as an extensible home for future Vortex tooling — both old folders/repos remain untouched
as historical/rollback reference.

## Quick start

```
npm install
npm run web
```

Opens `http://127.0.0.1:4321` with a top-level nav for both tool areas. Terminal CLI access is also
available (see below) for either flow without the web UI.

## Rebuild Collection

```
node rebuild-collection.js [--collection-mod-id <id>] [--staging <dir>] [--downloads <dir>]
  [--state <path>] [--backup-root <dir>] [--dry-run] [--resume <log-file>] [--yes]
```

Always run `--dry-run` first. See `lib/collection-runner.js`, `lib/rebuild-mod.js`, and the
extraction engine (`lib/simple-installer.js`, `lib/choice-resolver.js`, `lib/fomod-parser.js`,
`lib/sevenzip.js`) for how this works. Other CLI entry points (`extract-mod.js`,
`compare-output.js`, `smoke-test-collection.js`, `snapshot-collection-staging.js`,
`download-collection.js`, `check-vortex-source-drift.js`) are validation/utility tools used during
this engine's own development — see comments in each file.

**After a real (non-dry-run) rebuild, expect Vortex to show "External Changes" the next time it
starts**, for every mod that came back `REBUILT` — this is expected, not a sign of a real problem.
`rebuildMod()` swaps a rebuilt mod into place via `fs.renameSync` (crash-safety — see the header
comment in `lib/rebuild-mod.js`), which always creates a brand-new file on disk, even when its
content and `LastWriteTime` end up byte-identical to what was already deployed (the archive itself
supplies each entry's stored timestamp, not "now"). Vortex's own deployment tracking follows file
identity, not just content or mtime, so it correctly notices the staged file is no longer the same
physical file it last deployed — confirmed directly against a real case (`Laundry.esp` inside
"ESLified Patches"): identical size, identical `LastWriteTime`, identical SHA256 between staged and
deployed, but different NTFS File IDs, with `CreationTime` on the staged copy matching the exact
rebuild run that touched it. **Verified content is genuinely unchanged in this scenario** (that's
what a clean `REBUILT` status already guarantees — a rebuild only swaps in when its own missing/
changed diff came back clean) — safe to click **"Use newer file"** / **"Save all changes"** and
deploy in Vortex.

## Known FOMOD authoring quirks (confirmed real-world)

`lib/fomod-parser.js` / `lib/choice-resolver.js` replay a collection's recorded FOMOD choices
against the real archive's `ModuleConfig.xml`. Real, shipped mods have exposed several
non-obvious authoring patterns that a naive reading of the FOMOD spec would get wrong — each is
handled explicitly, with the archive that first exposed it noted for traceability:

- **Duplicate installStep names.** Two install steps can share the exact same `name` (e.g. two
  mutually-exclusive variant steps both called "Mesh Patches - Masks", gated on different earlier
  choices). Matching by name breaks the instant this happens — `.find()` always returns the first
  match, silently applying the wrong step's (possibly empty) recorded choices. Vortex records one
  `choices.options` entry per raw installStep **unconditionally, in document order**, including
  steps whose `<visible>` condition was never actually met (their entry just has empty/default
  selections) — so **array position, not name**, is the only reliable match key. (Confirmed via
  "Dragon Priests Retexture SE - Half Res".)
- **Whitespace-padded names.** `fast-xml-parser` trims attribute values by default, but a real
  mod's own XML can have a trailing space in a `name` attribute (`name="High Poly Vanilla Male
  Body "`) that Vortex's recorded `collection.json` preserves verbatim. An exact-string group/step
  name comparison silently fails to find the recorded entry. Always compare `.trim()`ed on both
  sides. (Confirmed via "Nordic Faces - Textures and Body Meshes".)
- **Non-empty-string "install at mod root" destinations.** An explicit empty-string
  `destination=""` on a `<file>`/`<folder>` entry is already documented FOMOD behavior for
  "install at the mod root, using just the source's basename" — but real authors also write this
  same intent as a literal `destination=".\<file>"` ("Faster HDT-SMP FSMP 3.5.0") or a bare
  `destination="."` (20 different `<folder>` entries in "Dwemer Armor SE - CBBE 3BA"). All three
  forms must normalize to the same result — `path.win32.normalize()` handles `.\`/`./` correctly
  but does **not** collapse a lone `.` further, so that case needs an explicit extra fold to `""`.

**How to validate any future change here against this user's real, live modded install — safely,
with zero writes**: for every mod in a real `collection.json` with `choices.type === 'fomod'` and
an existing staging folder, re-run the real pipeline (`findModRoot` → extract+parse the real
`ModuleConfig.xml` → `resolveChoices`) and diff the resulting destination-path set against
`buildManifest()` of what's actually on disk in that mod's staging folder. A clean diff across a
real collection's full FOMOD-choice mod list is strong evidence a change is correct; any mismatch
is either a bug to chase or (confirm via the mod's own recorded `choices`) a genuine cross-collection
choice divergence that's *supposed* to surface as `FAILED_MISMATCH_NOT_TOUCHED`.

## Vortex ".ghost" files (a deliberate disable choice, not a mismatch)

Vortex marks a deployed file as disabled-but-present by appending `.ghost` to its name (e.g.
right-click "never deploy this file", or a manual conflict-resolution choice) rather than deleting
it. A fresh archive extraction never contains a `.ghost`-suffixed name — that suffix only ever gets
applied by Vortex itself, after deployment — so naively diffing the two would call the archive's
plain file "added" and the current `.ghost` file "missing", and every rebuild path would then handle
that wrong in its own way: an ordinary clean rebuild's whole-folder swap silently discards the
`.ghost` file (a fresh extraction has nothing to carry it forward with), while the manual "Keep
modified" merge restored the plain, *active* file right alongside the still-present ghost. Confirmed
live (2026-07-24, "Dragonborn UI for GTS - Resources"): both `Disable Map Markers.esp` and
`...esp.ghost` ended up on disk at once, byte-identical, after clicking "Keep modified".

`lib/ghost-files.js` strips any ghost/plain pair (matched case-insensitively, same convention as
`diff-manifests-ci.js`'s NTFS-case-preservation handling) from both manifests before diffing, so a
legitimately-ghosted file no longer even triggers `FAILED_MISMATCH_NOT_TOUCHED` by itself. Per the
user's explicit call, a skipped ghost file's content is never reconciled against a possibly-newer
archive version — it's left completely untouched, and the skip is logged (`ghostPreserved` on a
normal/`keep-existing` result) rather than done silently. `resolveMode: 'all'` (full replace) is the
one exception: consistent with how it already discards a local ESL-only choice, a full replace also
discards the `.ghost` file — but now logs that it did, instead of doing it silently.

## Vortex's Workshop-tab collection folders (`vortex_collection_<id>`)

Every collection you've ever added to Vortex's **Workshop** tab (authoring/curating your own,
whether ever published or not) gets its own folder under the staging directory, named with Vortex's
raw internal id (`vortex_collection_<random>`), distinct from a real *installed* collection's
archive-derived folder name (`<Name>-<modId>-<revision>-<timestamp>`). This project's collection
picker treats the two completely differently (see the naming-convention checks in
`scanStagingCollections`/`scanAllCollections`) — only archive-named folders are real, rebuildable
collections; `vortex_collection_*` ones only ever show in the Workshop dropdown, regardless of
what's on disk inside them.

**The root `collection.json` in one of these folders cannot be trusted as "current state."**
Confirmed directly (2026-07-24): editing a Workshop collection's mod list in Vortex's UI (adding or
removing mods) does not touch the root `collection.json` at all — not its content, not even its
mtime. The real, live edit state lives entirely in Vortex's own internal database the whole time.
The root file only ever reflects whatever it was when first written by Vortex itself (apparently
once, early on) and then sits frozen until something explicitly overwrites it — either Vortex doing
so again at some later point, or this project's own "Fetch from Nexus" (below), which writes
directly into this same root path. Proven on a real collection where the root file (mtime unchanged
since 2025-12-29, predating this project's own Fetch feature entirely) listed 44 mods, but
publishing a new revision immediately afterward produced a `collection.json` with 67 mods (19
removed, 42 added since whatever point the root file was last accurate) inside the freshly-written
`export/collection_<N>.7z`.

That `export/collection_<N>.7z` (one .7z per locally-packaged revision, e.g. `collection_0.7z`,
`collection_2.7z`) is the one place a genuinely *current* local snapshot exists — written the moment
you package/publish a revision from Vortex's Workshop editor, containing the real `collection.json`
as of that exact action. If you need the actual current state of a Workshop collection without
publishing first, the only reliable options are that latest `export/collection_<N>.7z`, or a live
read of Vortex's own state DB (the collection's `rules` array reflects real-time edits, confirmed
against "My Empowering The NPCs").

This is also why this project's "Fetch from Nexus" feature (see **Update Collection** below and the
Workshop picker) always downloads fresh from Nexus's own CDN rather than ever reading a local
`export/*.7z` — nothing on disk in one of these folders can be assumed to match what's actually
published, so there's no shortcut worth trusting over asking Nexus directly for a specific revision.
A successful fetch overwrites the folder's root `collection.json` with that freshly-downloaded
content, then goes straight to the Plan view for it (same as clicking "View Collection" for a real
installed collection) — a fetched `collection.json` is just as usable to `computePlan` as any real
one, since neither it nor `resolveCollectionInfo` cares about the `vortex_collection_*` naming
convention at all (that only decides which picker dropdown a collection shows up in).

## Update Collection

```
node sync-menu.js      # interactive terminal menu (recommended)
node sync-cli.js <command> [options]   # flag-based CLI (list-collections, backup, apply-ignores,
                                        # apply-disables, compare, list-backups, ...)
```

Three-phase, human-in-the-loop workflow (Vortex itself performs the actual mod installation — this
tool only brackets that step):

1. **Backup** (Vortex closed) — snapshots which mods are currently ignored/disabled for a
   collection.
2. In Vortex: click **Update** → **Download Update** → choose **Later** (not Install Now).
3. **Apply Ignores** (Vortex closed) — marks the backed-up ignored mods as ignored in the *new*
   collection's rules, so Vortex's installer skips them.
4. In Vortex: click **Resume**. This is the slow step (Vortex's own archive extraction) — not
   controlled by this tool.
5. **Apply Disables** (Vortex closed) — restores the disabled state on mods that should stay
   disabled, now that Vortex has assigned them real mod IDs.
6. **Compare** (optional, anytime) — generates an HTML report of what changed vs. a backup, without
   touching Vortex's state at all.

See `lib/vortex-sync/lib.js` for the full implementation and `lib/sync-runner.js` for the
framework-agnostic orchestration shared by the CLI, terminal menu, and web UI.

## Safety notes

- Vortex must be fully closed before any state-database read or write — both flows check this and
  refuse otherwise.
- Any live *write* to Vortex's state DB (`apply-ignores`/`apply-disables`) takes a full backup of
  the entire `state.v2` directory first (`lib/vortex-sync/state-backups/`, gitignored — **can
  contain Vortex's stored Nexus API tokens, never commit or share this directory**).
- All state-database access (reads and writes) runs in an isolated child process with a timeout —
  `classic-level`/LevelDB has been confirmed able to hit a native, unrecoverable assertion crash on
  certain real-world write-ahead-log shapes, even with Vortex fully closed. Isolation means a crash
  only kills that one short-lived worker, not the whole server; if a run seems to hang, check your
  taskbar for a hidden Windows assertion dialog and click Abort.
- Rebuild Collection never writes to Vortex's state database at all — only to the staging
  filesystem layer, using a crash-safe `.rebuilding`/`.old` swap (mirroring Vortex's own
  `.installing` convention) so an interruption never leaves a half-extracted mod in place.
- Expect Vortex's own "External Changes" prompt after a real rebuild, for every `REBUILT` mod —
  this is expected, not a sign of corruption. See the note under **Rebuild Collection** above.
- **`logs/` is not backed up by anything in this project** — it's the *only* record of a
  collection's rebuild history (status per mod, "last extracted" timestamps, missing/changed file
  diffs), and it's just plain JSON on disk, as deletable as any other file here. Include it in
  whatever backup routine already covers the rest of your Skyrim/Vortex setup.

## Future work

Eventually replacing Vortex's own slow "Resume" install step with this project's fast direct
extraction, for the Update Collection flow too — so collection updates become as fast as rebuilds
already are. Real, unsolved blockers: Rebuild Collection's engine only ever touches the staging
filesystem, with zero awareness of Vortex's state database; Vortex itself must still register any
new/changed staging folder as a tracked mod entry (state-DB record, correct per-profile enabled
state, load-order integration) — today only Vortex's own "Resume" step does this, and nothing in
this project creates a brand-new mod entry from scratch. This needs its own research spike (reading
Vortex's real installer source, the way `vortex-source-refs.json`/`check-vortex-source-drift.js`
already do for the extraction side) before any design is attempted.
